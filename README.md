Introduction
---
This code is the core of the collation editor. The code in this repository is not designed to run as it is.
It needs to be embedded into a larger platform with a database or similar storage. The connections are made with a services file writen in Javascript. Further configuration of settings and other options can also be provided if needed. Data input is all in JSON.
